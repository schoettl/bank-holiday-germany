# bank-holiday-germany

This module provides calculation of bank holidays in Germany.

Most of these bank holidays are also public aka legal holidays
throughout Germany. You can use `isPublicHoliday` to check if a
holiday is also a legal holiday.

Legal holidays are generally off for all employees. Bank holidays that
are no legal holidays as well are generally only off for bank employees.

Note: There are even more public holidays in each federal state which
are not covered by this module.
